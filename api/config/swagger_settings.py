    "TITLE": "URL Shortener API",
    "DESCRIPTION": """A Django URL shortener app is a web application that allows users to create short, customized links that redirect to longer URLs. The app typically has a simple user interface that accepts a long URL as input and generates a short URL that can be shared with others. When a user clicks on the short link, they are redirected to the original long URL.

The Django URL shortener app typically utilizes the Django web framework, which provides robust web development tools and a powerful object-relational mapper for working with databases. The app may also incorporate additional third-party libraries or services to support URL shortening, such as Bitly or TinyURL.

The app will typically include a database that stores both the original long URLs and their corresponding short URLs. This database can be used to track usage statistics for each short URL, including the number of clicks and the referrer of each click.

The app will also include functionality to generate unique short URLs that are easy to remember and share. This may involve the use of a hashing algorithm or other techniques to create short, randomized URLs that are unique to each long URL.

Overall, a Django URL shortener app provides a convenient way for users to share links without having to remember long or complicated URLs. It is a useful tool for marketers, social media managers, and anyone who wants to streamline the process of sharing links online.""",
